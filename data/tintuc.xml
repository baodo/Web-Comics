		<noidung>
				Summer after high school when we first met
				We make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
				And on my 18th birthday
				We got matching tattoos
				Used to steal your parents’ liquor
				And climb to the roof
				Talk about our future
				Like we had a clue
				Never planned on one day
				I’d be losing you

				In another life
				I would be your girl
				We’d keep all our promises
				Be us against the world
				In another life
				I would make you stay
				So I don’t have to say
				You were the one that got away
				The one that got away

				All this money can’t buy me a time machine, no
				Can’t replace you with a million rings, no
				I should have you told you what you meant to me, whoa
				‘Cause now I pay the price
